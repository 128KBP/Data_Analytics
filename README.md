###### In the beginning these documents relied heavily on financial analysis tools. In order to decode the trend line. Elwave software was used, and highlighted the  error margin within floating point calculations. This is decoherence essentially, and the first introduction to what would become multivariable statistical mechanics. 

###### And put simply it's the idea that we can be given, multiple end points, for any given input. And can never be quite sure of the certainty, in view of the most probabable outcome. With the later iterations of this work {Angular Momentum}. It crosses the divide of decoherence. And therefore begins to pin Schrodinger's equation to a certainty matrix, in the measurement of multivariable statistical mechanics {Data Cartography}.
